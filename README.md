RotMG Drop Tracker is a hobby project designed to help players track their loot drops in Realm of the Mad God. The app lets you record and view what items you’ve looted — per character, class, and season — with a focus on whitebags, STs, and other rare items.

The app features a clean, modern GUI, stores your data in a MongoDB database, and is built with cross-platform support in mind through Docker.

💡 Features
	•	Track loot by character, class, and season
	•	Intuitive interface with item icons and rarity-colored borders (common, rare, legendary, divine, etc.)
	•	Hoverable tooltips showing item name and rarity
	•	Planned: Character graveyard with item list at death
	•	Fully offline — your data stays with you

🚧 Still in development.
I’m open to suggestions, feedback, and improvements!

🙏 If you’d like to support this project, I’d really appreciate it — even a kind word helps!
